# CraftingHomes

-----------------
A simple Home plugin.

By itself, this is supposed to be a simple Home 
plugin (for now) that has the basic commands `/home`, `/homes`,
`/sethome`, `/delhome` and 3 Homes per player.

## Roadmap
- [ ] Persistant Data Storage
- [ ] Configurable Homes per player
- [ ] Translation
- [ ] Dependency Injection for command discovery
- [ ] abstract command definition syntax (with annotations)
- [ ] possibility for other implementations like fabric or forge
